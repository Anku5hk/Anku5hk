### Hi there Ankush HereðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer who's actively looking for opportinuities in Machine Learning. I have good knowledge about Software Engineering, General Machine Learning, Computer Vision Applications, Deep Learning Algorithms and Some NLP.

- ðŸ”­ Recently, I have build [HELPMEREAD](https://github.com/Anku5hk/Help-Me-Read), a End-to-End flask application which uses NLP to generate summaries, Generate Questions and verifies User's Answers.
- ðŸ”­ I have build android application to test common computer vision model's inference on android [here](https://github.com/Anku5hk/Android-Model-Tester).
- ðŸ”­ I also have some computer vision [notebooks](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/tree/master/Image%20processing) which i made when i self learned computer vision using [this](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/courses/cap6411/cap5415/) course.
- ðŸ”­ Some of my kaggle Competition solutions are [here](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/tree/master/Kaggle%20competitions%20solutions).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more deep learning, more computer vision, ML Engineering.
- ðŸ”­ My daily drivers include Python, Pytorch, Numpy.
