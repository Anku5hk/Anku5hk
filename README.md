I am a Software Engineer who's tinkering with Machine Learning. I have good knowledge about Software Engineering, General Machine Learning, Computer Vision Applications, Deep Learning Algorithms and Some NLP.

- ðŸ”­ All of my Recent work activity on deep learning and computer vision applications can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/)
- ðŸ”­ I have build [HELPMEREAD](https://github.com/Anku5hk/Help-Me-Read), a flask application which uses NLP to generate Text Summaries, Generate Questions, also verifies User's Answers using text similarity, a dedicated website is under works.
- ðŸ”­ I have written [A Programmer's guide to Python](https://github.com/Anku5hk/Programmers_guide_to_Python), which can help you learn python faster if you know other programming languages like c, c++ or java.
- ðŸ”­ I have build 2 Android applications [Android-Image-Finder](https://github.com/Anku5hk/Image-Finder-Android) to find images on local directory using OCR/Image Classification   Another to test common computer vision model's inference [here](https://github.com/Anku5hk/Android-Model-Tester).
- ðŸ”­ I also have some computer vision [notebooks](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/tree/master/Image%20processing) which i made when i self learned computer vision using [this](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/courses/cap6411/cap5415/) course.
- ðŸ”­ Some of my kaggle Competition solutions are [here](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/tree/master/Kaggle%20competitions%20solutions).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more deep learning, more computer vision, more NLP, ML Engineering, Software Engineering.
- ðŸ”­ My daily drivers include Python, Pytorch, Numpy.
- ðŸ“ƒ My [learning list](https://github.com/Anku5hk/The_ML_Workflow/blob/master/my_resources_list.md).
